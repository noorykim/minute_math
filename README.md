These are programs which generate PDF worksheets for practice with arithmetic.
The programs were largely generated by AI (Grok3).

These are meant to be printed out and done with pencil.
The program also generates an answer key on a separate page.

For multiplication, the default setting generates problems for times tables from 1x1 up to 12x12, but you can change the min and max values.

The worksheets are not flashy, but neither is arithmetic. Still, you could make a game of it by seeing how fast and accurately they can complete them and award prizes. (I would emphasize accuracy over speed.)
I had worksheets like this in elementary school, where we were given a badge if we got 40 problems right out of 40 within 60 seconds, and then got our names posted on a board near the school entrance.

These worksheets have 25 problems per page, and it is possible for a 4th grader with practice to complete them in under a minute.
